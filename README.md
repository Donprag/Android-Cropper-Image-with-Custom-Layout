# Android Cropper Image with Custom Layout

A simple image cropper project where you can customize your own image cropper, from the layout to the code.

## Usage

- Can be used with your own custom layout.
- Load image from any sources (e.g. url, uri, glideUrl, bitmap, res drawable).
- Allows scaling the cropper with either a fixed 1:1 ratio or a free-form ratio.
- Returns the result from the image cropper as a bitmap (or you can modify it as desired).

### Notes:
- Currently, you can only scale by dragging the corners (top, bottom, left, right) of the cropper.
- This is not a library, just a sample project that you can modify to suit your needs.
